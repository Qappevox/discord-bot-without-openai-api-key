# discord-bot-without-openai-api-key
This project enables you to ask questions to GPT without using the ChatGPT API key. You need to enter the coordinates of the required places with Pyautogui. Debugging has not yet been done for code questions, so span information remains. The project can be further developed, but I am uploading it in its current state as I have grown tired of working on it.
